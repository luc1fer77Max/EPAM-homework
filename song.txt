Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap

Kiss me momma, kiss your boy
Bless me well and lucky
For I won't be back til' I return
I'm gone to old Kentucky
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
That's what the scouts all tell ya
Sure enough it may get tough
If it doesn't kill ya, kill ya

Kentucky she's a waiting on the other side
Give you the fever, put the daylight in your eyes
