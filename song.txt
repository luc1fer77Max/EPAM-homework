Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap

Kiss me momma, kiss your boy
Bless me well and lucky
For I won't be back til' I return
I'm gone to old Kentucky
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
That's what the scouts all tell ya
Sure enough it may get tough
If it doesn't kill ya, kill ya

Kentucky she's a waiting on the other side
Give you the fever, put the daylight in your eyes

Brother John's already gone
With the full-blood Cherokee maiden
He made the trip in the blizzard's grip
I'd rather wrestle Satan
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Oh, the snow kept coming
Picked her up upon his back
By God, he loved that woman!

Daniel stood on the pinnacle rock
Lookin' up and down the mountain
Took his trusty old flint-lock
Daniel started shoutin', shoutin':

Kentucky she's a waiting on the other side
Give you the fever, put the daylight in your eyes

Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
